            <div class="faq-body">
              <p>In order to get a view of a rat’s family tree, navigate the sidebar and find the tab that says ‘Search’
                and click on it. Once on the associated page enter the rat’s sex and number into the associated drop
                down and text box.
                Once the data has been input click the ‘Make Tree’ button. Then the family tree of the rat going back to
                its grandparents of both its sire and its dam will be displayed.

              <p>The data we received was originally incomplete, so there are gaps in the numbers assigned to rats. Any
                added data through the program should not cause a gap in the number of rats.
